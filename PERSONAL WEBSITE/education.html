        <p class="molina">Molina Kids Care Learning Center</p>
        <p class="description">Molina was the first school I ever studied at. I attended Molina since preschool, as you can see in the graduation picture from when I was in prep. I received many medals throughout my time there, as I was an achiever from a young age. I vividly remember crying when my parents left me at Molina, but fortunately, the teachers were friendly, and I grew to love the school. Even now, the principal recognizes me when I visit since the school is near my house. I'm grateful that Molina became such an integral part of my life.</p>

        <p class="nsnu">Nazareth School of National University</p>
        <p class="description">NSNU holds a significant place in my heart and life. I practically grew up there, having studied at NSNU from grade 1 to grade 12. Over those 12 years, I witnessed how NSNU evolved. I deeply appreciate the people who surrounded me, especially my friends, as I have wonderful memories with them at this school. As you can see from the picture, I also achieved a lot during my time at NSNU. The photo captures my graduation from grade 12, marking the end of my time there. It was a bittersweet moment because NSNU had become my second home, and leaving was difficult. However, that's what life is all about, we must move on in order to continue growing.</p>

        <p class="description">PLM is one of my dream schools in college. Since high school, I always told myself that I wanted to study at PLM, and fortunately, I was accepted and given the opportunity to study there. I was ecstatic when PLM accepted me because my family also wanted me to attend that school. Adjusting to PLM was challenging since it was a completely new environment for me after spending 12 years in the same setting as a child. Thankfully, I am gradually adapting to my college life at PLM, thanks to the warm welcome and friendliness of the friends I've made. I truly hope to graduate and thoroughly enjoy my college experience at PLM.</p>
