            <br><br>
            <p class="text animation">Hey there! I'm Sofia Alexi P. Navarro, but you can call me Alexi. I'm 18 year old residing in Sampaloc, Manila, Philippines. During my senior high school years, I excelled in my class and received high honors. When I'm not studying, I enjoy indulging in Korean dramas, movies, and games as a way to unwind. Cooking and experimenting with new recipes at home is another passion of mine, while sharing it with my family and friends... <br><br><span class="moreText"> In life, one of my biggest aspirations is to have a healthy and happy family while pursuing a business that truly brings me joy. I also have a strong desire to explore the world and spoil my loved ones with the things they love, which is why I also aim to achieve financial success. Throughout my 18 years of life, I've learned valuable lessons that changed my perspective in life. One of the most important ones is to seize every opportunity to enjoy life to the fullest because it's too short to be wasted. Therefore, let's cherish every moment we have with our loved ones and make lasting memories together. <br><br> Personally, I promise to find happiness in life and stay strong through tough times. Challenges will be opportunities for me to grow, and I'll face them with unwavering determination.</span></p>
